The `prometheus.yaml` file is a Prometheus configuration file, 
which defines how Prometheus should scrape metrics, 
including the scrape intervals and job configurations. 


`prometheus.yaml` file should be used by Prometheus itself. 
When deploying Prometheus, particularly in a Kubernetes environment, 
this configuration file is often mounted into the Prometheus pod using a ConfigMap. 



### Step 1: Create a ConfigMap from the Prometheus Configuration

1.Create a ConfigMap in Kubernetes that contains this file. 


kubectl create configmap prometheus-config --from-file=prometheus.yaml -n istio-system


This command creates a ConfigMap named `prometheus-config` in the `istio-system` 
namespace (or whichever namespace to deploy Prometheus in).

### Step 2: Deploy Prometheus using the ConfigMap

When deploying Prometheus, you'll need to make sure the Prometheus deployment is configured to 
use the `prometheus-config` ConfigMap as its configuration. 
If you're deploying Prometheus manually using a Deployment manifest, 
you would include a volume that mounts the ConfigMap into the container. 
Here's an example snippet to include in your Prometheus deployment manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: prometheus
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: prometheus
        image: prom/prometheus:v2.26.0
        args:
          - "--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yaml"
          - "--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus/"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: prometheus-config-volume
          mountPath: /etc/prometheus
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: prometheus-config-volume
        configMap:
          name: prometheus-config
```

This manifest assumes you are deploying Prometheus in the `istio-system` namespace 
and mounts the `prometheus-config` ConfigMap to the Prometheus pod. 
The Prometheus server is then configured to use the `prometheus.yaml` file from the mounted volume.

### Step 3: Apply the Deployment Manifest

After preparing your Prometheus deployment manifest that includes the ConfigMap volume, 
apply it using `kubectl`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f prometheus-deployment.yaml
```

Ensure that the file name (`prometheus-deployment.yaml`) matches the name of your 
file containing the deployment configuration.

 
This approach allows Prometheus to use your custom configuration to scrape 
metrics from your Istio service mesh and other targets as specified.
